# Refactoring Log

This is the refactoring log for `Tortuga.Data.Snowflake`. It starts with version 2.0.11 of `Snowflake.Data`.

## Round 0 - Setup and Validation

* Rename projects and folders.
* Change supported frameworks to: net472, netstandard2.0, netcoreapp3.1, net6.0
* Fix compiler warnings for package conflicts.
* Add .editorconfig file.
* Fix tests.
* Delete tests marked as ignored.
* General cleanup of project files.

### Framework Version

Tests failed with .NET 4.6.2 with a platform not supported exception, so the minimum version was left at 4.7.2.


### Unit Tests

After adding a `parameters.json` file, all tests are still failing with this error message. 

```
	OneTimeSetUp: System.IO.FileNotFoundException : Could not find file 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\parameters.json'.
```

The problem is in this line of code:

```
StreamReader reader = new StreamReader("parameters.json");
```

An application's current directory is not guaranteed, so tests should use absolute paths. 

```
var path = Path.Combine(Path.GetDirectoryName(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location), "parameters.json");
StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(path);
```

The connection string builder (in the tests, not `SnowflakeDbConnectionStringBuilder`) also needed to be changed to ignore the warehouse and role parameters.

At this point all remaining tests are passing. 

## Round 1 - Formatting
* General code formatting with CodeMaid and `.editorconfig`
* C# 10 features enabled
* Implicit using statements turned on
* Change the namespaces to use the `Tortuga` prefix.
* Remove unused namespaces

The members in the classes cannot be sorted. This causes the `TestSimpleLargeResultSet` test to fail. The reason has not yet been determined, but most likely has something to do with serialization.
